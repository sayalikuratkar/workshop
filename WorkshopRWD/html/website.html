            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation
                dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write
                once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
                without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any
                Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar
                to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities
                (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled
                languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20]
                particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers</p>

            <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
                readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented
                approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[30]Python
                is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured
                (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries
                included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31]</p>
